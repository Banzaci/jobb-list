# Getting Started with Jobb list project

1. Clone the project `git clone git@github.com:Banzaci/jobb-list.git`

2. In the project directory, you can run to install all packages:

### `yarn`

3. Once installed, you can run

### `yarn start`

4. Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

I decided to use [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) as the CSS library, [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com) as icon library and [React router 6.4](https://reactrouter.com/en/main).
